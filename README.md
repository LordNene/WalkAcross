# WalkAcross

Authors: Jakub Bohoš (design), Jozef Bátrna (programming)
Platform: Android (but current build is for PC)

Digital board game / card game prototype with multiplayer using Mirror and simple Client-Server architecture.  

The goal of the game is to connect opposite sides (of player's color) of the game board. Cards are either monochromatic in player's color or bicolored and I generated their sprites through code. This means that gameboard's size (and in turn numbers on cards) could change. (And also that I didn't have to manually set up all the assets.)
